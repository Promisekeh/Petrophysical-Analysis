## Introduction

Petrophysical analysis involves the study of physical and chemical properties of rocks and their interactions with fluids. This lecture series aims to equip you with the knowledge and tools to perform petrophysical analysis using Python.

## Course Structure

The course is structured into lectures, each focusing on different aspects of petrophysical analysis. Each lecture includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks with explanations, examples, and exercises.


## Lectures
Lecture 1: Introduction to Petrophysics and Python
- Overview of petrophysics
- Introduction to Python programming
- Setting up your Python environment

Lecture 2: Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Introduction to common petrophysical data formats (LAS, CSV)
- Loading data into Python
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques

Lecture 3: Basic Petrophysical Calculations
- Calculating key petrophysical properties (e.g., porosity, permeability)
- Implementing calculations in Python

Lecture 4: Visualization Techniques
- Plotting well logs
- Cross-plotting petrophysical properties
- Creating publication-quality figures

Lecture 5: Advanced Analysis Techniques
- Multivariate analysis
- Machine learning applications in petrophysics

Usage
Each lecture will contain Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the concepts and practical examples. To start a lecture, navigate to the corresponding directory and open the notebook.
